<h1>Thursday seminar Spring 2022</h1>
<h2>Exponent theorems in homotopy theory</h2>

We will study exponent theorems, following the work of Selick,
Cohen-Moore-Neisendorfer, Gray, etc., as well as the more recent work of
Heuts, Wang, and others.

<b>Time and place:</b> Thursdays at 3:00 pm, in-person in SC 507.

<b>Tentative schedule:</b>

| Date | Speaker | Topic |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Feb 17 | Mike Hopkins | Overview |
| Feb 24 | TBD | Tools of unstable homotopy theory, James' 2-primary exponent theorem, Selick's theorem on $$S^3$$ |
| March 3 | TBD | Continuation, overview of proof of Cohen-Moore-Neisendorfer |
| March 10 | TBD | Starting the proof of CMN: the fiber $$F^{2n+1}\{p^r\}$$ of the pinch map $$S^{2n}/p^r \to S^{2n+1}$$ |
| March 17 | TBD | Continuing the proof of CMN: product decomposition of $$\Omega F^{2n+1}\{p^r\}$$ and building the map $$\phi_n: \Omega^2 S^{2n+1} \to S^{2n-1}$$ |
| March 24 | TBD | Complements: Anick spaces and the fiber of the double suspension |
| March 31 | TBD | EHP sequences and chromatic periodicity |
| April 7 | TBD | Weiss calculus and unstable periodicity |
| April 14 | TBD | Higher chromatic exponents following Heuts and Wang |
| April 21 | TBD | Motivic variants? |
