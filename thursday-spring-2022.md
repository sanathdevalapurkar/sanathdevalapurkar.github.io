<h1>Thursday seminar Spring 2022</h1>
<h2>Exponent theorems in homotopy theory</h2>

We will study exponent theorems, following the work of Selick,
Cohen-Moore-Neisendorfer, Gray, etc., as well as the more recent work of
Arone, Heuts, Wang, and others.

<b>Time and place:</b> Thursdays <b>3:30 - 5:30 pm</b>, in-person in SC 507.
(But there may be a Zoom option, email Mike for a Zoom link.)

<b>Tentative schedule:</b>

| Date | Speaker | Topic |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Feb 17 | Mike Hopkins | Introduction and overview of exponent theorems |
| Feb 24 | Ishan Levy | Tools of unstable homotopy theory, James' 2-primary exponent theorem (Chapters 1-10 of Cohen's course notes) |
| March 3 | Paul Selick | Selick's theorem on $$S^3$$ + Gray's delooping of the fiber of $$S^{2n-1} \to \Omega^2 S^{2n+1}$$ + ... |
| March 10 | TBD | Starting the proof of CMN: the fiber $$F^{2n+1}\{p^r\}$$ of the pinch map $$S^{2n}/p^r \to S^{2n+1}$$ |
| March 17 | N/A | Harvard spring break |
| March 24 | TBD | Continuing the proof of CMN: product decomposition of $$\Omega F^{2n+1}\{p^r\}$$ and building the map $$\phi_n: \Omega^2 S^{2n+1} \to S^{2n-1}$$ |
| March 31 | Paul Selick | Complements: Anick spaces and the fiber of the double suspension |
