<h1>Integrable systems (Math 99r, Spring 2024)</h1>

Integrable systems are particularly nice differential equations which have a
large collection of "conserved quantities". The geometry of the space of
solutions to such systems is often highly interesting. The goal of this course
is to give an example-based introduction to this theory, starting with classic
examples like the harmonic oscillator and the Euler top, describe the theory of
Lax pairs, and use all of this to motivate the symplectic geometry perspective
on integrable systems. There is a lot of rich history behind this story (for
instance, the theory of integrable systems was one of Lie's original motivations
for the theory of Lie algebras!).
The main focus in the second half of this course will be the Calogero-Moser and
Toda integrable systems, and their construction due to
Kazhdan-Kostant-Sternberg. A more detailed syllabus and schedule will be posted
later. 

I will be typing up notes for (some of) the lectures and posting them on
this webpage. For the most part, I will follow Arnold's "Mathematical Methods of
Classical Mechanics" in the beginning of the course, and will decide on
references for later parts as we go along.

Most of your grade will be based off a final paper (probably around 80% of the
grade); and depending on the number of people who sign up, either a final 15-20
minute presentation <b>and</b> a few problems which will be due in the middle of
the semester (these problems will be of the form "explore the following topic",
and not "here is a problem, do it in exactly this way").

We will meet in <b>SC 232</b> on <b>Tuesdays, 4:30 - 6 pm</b> and <b>Fridays, 2
- 3 pm</b>.
