<h1>Integrable systems (Math 99r, Spring 2024)</h1>

Integrable systems are particularly nice differential equations which have a
large collection of "conserved quantities". The geometry of the space of
solutions to such systems is often highly interesting. The goal of this course
is to give an example-based introduction to this theory, starting with classic
examples like the harmonic oscillator and the Euler top, describe the theory of
Lax pairs, and use all of this to motivate the symplectic geometry perspective
on integrable systems. There is a lot of rich history behind this story (for
instance, the theory of integrable systems was one of Lie's original motivations
for the theory of Lie algebras!).
The main focus in the second half of this course will be the Calogero-Moser and
Toda integrable systems, and their construction due to
Kazhdan-Kostant-Sternberg. A more detailed syllabus and schedule will be posted
later. I will be typing up notes for the lectures and posting them on this
webpage.
