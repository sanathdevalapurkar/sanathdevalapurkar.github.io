<h1>Integrable systems (Math 99r, Spring 2024)</h1>

Integrable systems are particularly nice differential equations which have a
large collection of "conserved quantities". The geometry of the space of
solutions to such systems is often highly interesting. The goal of this course
is to give an example-based introduction to this theory, starting with classic
examples like the harmonic oscillator and the Euler top, describe the theory of
Lax pairs, and use all of this to motivate the symplectic geometry perspective
on integrable systems. There is a lot of rich history behind this story (for
instance, the theory of integrable systems was one of Lie's original motivations
for the theory of Lie algebras!).
The main focus in the second half of this course will be the Calogero-Moser and
Toda integrable systems, and their construction due to
Kazhdan-Kostant-Sternberg. A more detailed syllabus and schedule will be posted
later. 

I will be typing up notes for (some of) the lectures and posting them on
this webpage. For the most part, I will follow Arnold's "Mathematical Methods of
Classical Mechanics" in the beginning of the course. I also like
Libermann-Marle's "Symplectic Geometry and Analytical Mechanics", as well as
Abraham-Marsden's "Foundations of Mechanics".
I will add further references for later parts as we go along.

Most of your grade will be based off a final paper (probably around 80% of the
grade); and a few problems which will be due towards the end of the semester
(second week of April).

We will meet in <b>SC 232</b> on <b>Tuesdays, 4:30-6 pm</b> and in <b> SC
530</b> on <b>Fridays, 2-3 pm</b>.

<h2>Lectures</h2>

These notes were written hastily, so you should be sure to check what I have
written and supplement it through other sources.

<a href = "/files/math-99/lec0-math-99.pdf">Lecture 0: Introduction</a> (Jan
26). I have uploaded a recording of the lecture on Canvas.

<a href = "/files/math-99/lec1-math-99.pdf">Lecture 1: The Lagrangian
formalism</a> (Jan 30).

<a href = "/files/math-99/lec2-math-99.pdf">Lecture 2: The Legendre transform
and Hamiltonian mechanics</a> (Feb 2).

<a href = "/files/math-99/lec3-math-99.pdf">Lecture 3: Symplectic geometry</a>
(Feb 6).

No lecture on Feb 9 (<a href =
"https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/events-archive/category/aqft-lecture-series/">CMSA
lecture series</a>).

No lecture on Feb 13 (snowstorm).

<a href = "/files/math-99/lec4-math-99.pdf">Lecture 4: Hamiltonian reduction</a>
(Feb 16). (This spills over into the next lecture, and I expect that I've
started a domino effect...)

<a href = "/files/math-99/lec5-math-99.pdf">Lecture 5: Rigid body motion</a>
(Feb 20).

<a href = "/files/math-99/lec6-math-99.pdf">Lecture 6: Lax pairs</a> (Feb 23).
(Incomplete)

<a href = "/files/math-99/lec7-math-99.pdf">Lecture 7: Integrability</a>
(Feb 27).

Lecture 8: The Calogero-Moser system; see the first few chapters of <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606233">Etingof's notes</a>.

<h2>Problems</h2>

Here are <a href = "/files/math-99/psets-math-99.pdf">some problems</a>. I will
keep updating this file throughout the semester. Please try to do at least a
third of the problems, and submit them to me by email by the second week of
April.
