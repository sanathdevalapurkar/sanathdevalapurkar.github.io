<h1>Quantization in algebra and topology</h1>

I'm planning on running an informal seminar on quantization during summer 2021:
the goal is to study quantization from a modern perspective in its various
forms.  Here is a tentative <b><a href="/files/topics.pdf">list of
topics</a></b>.

The meetings will be on Zoom (email me if you are interested in joining), but
let me know if you are in Cambridge and would like to talk in person. I will
type up lecture notes and post them on this page.

<a href="/files/lecture-1.pdf">Lecture 1: overview</a> (June 8).

Lecture 2: Kontsevich's theorem, part one (Charles Fu) (June 15).

Lecture 3: Kontsevich's theorem, part two (Ben Gammage) (June 22).

Lecture 4: Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov, following Katzarkov-Kontsevich-Pantev (June
29).

Lecture 5: Hodge-de Rham degeneration, classical and homotopical (July 6).

Lecture 6: Koszul duality and deformation quantization (July 13).

Lecture 7: TBA (July 20).
