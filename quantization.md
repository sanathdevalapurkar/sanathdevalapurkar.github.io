<h1>Quantization in algebra and topology</h1>

I'm planning on running an informal seminar on quantization during summer 2021:
the goal is to study quantization from a modern perspective in its various
forms.  Here is a tentative <b><a href="/files/topics.pdf">list of
topics</a></b>.

The meetings will be on Zoom (email me if you are interested in joining), but
let me know if you are in Cambridge and would like to talk in person. I will
type up notes and post them on this page. Warning: there are almost certainly
mistakes in these notes!
