I'm a third-year graduate student at Harvard, fortunate to be advised by <a
href = "https://people.math.harvard.edu/~mjh/">Mike Hopkins</a> and <a href =
"https://people.math.harvard.edu/~gaitsgde/">Dennis Gaitsgory</a>. I'm broadly
interested in algebraic topology and geometric representation theory, but my
interests are constantly changing. 
</p>
<p>
Outside of math, I spend a bunch of time playing the drums, listening to (mostly
instrumental) prog metal, and playing basketball.

I was an undergraduate at MIT, where I majored in math (course 18) and minored
in physics (course 8).

<h2> Writings </h2>
<h3>Some projects</h3>

Comments or suggestions for improving any of these documents are greatly
appreciated!

* <a href = "/files/thh-Xn.pdf">Topological Hochschild homology, truncated
  Brown-Peterson spectra, and a topological Sen operator (preliminary
version).</a> Last update: Feb 2023. <br>
Proves a form of Bokstedt periodicity for $$\mathbf{E}_3$$-forms of a truncated
Brown-Peterson spectrum, by studying $$\mathrm{THH}$$ relative to Ravenel's Thom
spectra $$X(p^n)$$, which played a crucial role in the Devinatz-Hopkins-Smith
proof of the nilpotence theorem. This is used to describe a higher chromatic
analogue of the "Sen operator" of Bhatt-Drinfeld-Lurie; their behavior is
controlled by Cohen-Moore-Neisendorfer fibrations and is Koszul dual to the
nilpotence/Ravenel filtration of $$\mathrm{MU}$$.

* <a href = "/files/grG-regular.pdf">Chromatic aberrations of the geometric
  Satake equivalence over the regular locus (preliminary version).</a> Last
update: Feb 2023.<br> 
Studies the question of proving an analogue of the derived geometric Satake
equivalence of <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/alg-geom/9511007">Ginzburg</a>
and <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/0707.3799">Bezrukavnikov-Finkelberg</a>
(really, of the the <a href =
"https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0304173">Arkhipov-Bezrukavnikov-Ginzburg</a>
equivalence) with coefficients in complex K-theory and elliptic cohomology.
Shows, in the case of elliptic cohomology with associated elliptic curve $$E$$
(for instance), that the quotient $$\widetilde{\check{\mathfrak{g}}}/\check{G}$$
of the Grothendieck-Springer resolution in the right-hand side of the usual ABG
equivalence is to be replaced by the semistable locus in (the degree zero
component of) the Kontsevich-Mori compactification
$$\widetilde{\mathrm{Bun}}_{\check{G}}(E^\vee)$$.

* <a href = "/files/higher-dim-hdR-degen.pdf">Lifting to truncated
  Brown-Peterson spectra and Hodge-de Rham degeneration in characteristic $$p >
0$$.</a> Last update: Feb 2023. <a href =
"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00739">arXiv</a>.<br>
Shows that if a smooth proper variety $$X$$ over $$\mathbf{F}_p$$ of dimension
$$< p^n$$ has degenerating HKR spectral sequence, and $$\mathrm{QCoh}(X)$$ lifts
to the truncated Brown-Peterson spectrum $$\mathrm{BP}\langle n-1\rangle$$, then
the Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence degenerates at the $$E_1$$-page. This is
contrast to recent <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11389">work</a> of
Petrov, which proves a negative result in this direction.

* <a href = "/files/fgls-and-dR-complexes.pdf">Generalized $$n$$-series and de
  Rham complexes,</a> joint with my <a href =
"https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/usa/">PRIMES</a> student Max
Misterka. Last update: Feb 2023.<br>
Studies some basic algebraic and combinatorial properties of "generalized
$$n$$-series" over a commutative ring. In particular, proves several
generalizations of $$q$$-analogues of basic combinatorial results, and also
studies basic properties of a "$$F$$-de Rham complex" built from the data of a
formal group law. This latter construction appears in unpublished work of Arpon
Raksit, and also arises naturally in my forthcoming "Chromatic aberrations"
article (via the loop-rotation equivariant homology of the affine Grassmannian
of a torus).

* <a href="/files/FramedStructure.pdf">Examples of disk algebras (2023),</a>
  joint with <a href = "http://web.mit.edu/~jhahn01/www/">Jeremy Hahn</a>, <a
href = "https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~tlawson/">Tyler Lawson</a>, <a href =
"https://people.math.harvard.edu/~senger/">Andrew Senger</a>, and <a href =
"https://people.math.harvard.edu/~dwilson/">Dylan Wilson</a>. Last update: 
Feb 2023. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11702">arXiv</a>.<br>
Shows that many familiar ring spectra, like $$\mathrm{BP}$$,
$$\mathrm{BP}\langle n\rangle$$, $$X(n)$$, and spherical polynomial algebras on
even degree classes admit *framed* $$\mathbf{E}_2$$-algebra structures.

* <a href="/files/thom.pdf">Higher chromatic Thom spectra via unstable homotopy
  theory (2020).</a> Last update: August 2022. <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08951">arXiv</a>. To appear in <i>Algebr. Geom.
Topol.</i><br>
Proves that a conjecture in unstable homotopy theory related to the
Cohen-Moore-Neisendorfer theorem, coupled with a conjecture about the
$$\mathbf{E}_3$$-centrality of a certain element in the homotopy of Ravenel's
$$X(n)$$ spectra, leads to a construction of truncated Brown-Peterson spectra,
$$\mathrm{bo}$$, and $$\mathrm{tmf}$$ as Thom spectra (albeit not over the
sphere); this is a higher chromatic analogue of the Hopkins-Mahowald theorem
constructing $$\mathrm{H}\mathbf{F}_p$$ as a Thom spectrum. The construction of
tmf via this method is used to show that these conjectures imply that the string
orientation $$\mathrm{MString} \to \mathrm{tmf}$$ splits.
<br>
Last update: moved (and greatly expanded) certain results to some forthcoming
papers.

* <a href="/files/hodge.pdf">Hodge theory for elliptic curves and the Hopf
  element $$\nu$$ (2019).</a> Last update: August 2022. <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02548">arXiv</a>, but the arXiv is having
issues with the spectralsequences TeX package that I've used in the newer
version; so the version on the arXiv is currently out-of-date. Published in
<i><a href =
"https://londmathsoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1112/blms.12759">Bull. Lond.
Math. Soc.</a></i><br>
Shows that the sheaf on the moduli stack of elliptic curves associated to
$$\nu$$ is isomorphic to the de Rham cohomology of the universal elliptic curve.
Uses this to study the $$\mathbf{E}_1$$-quotient of $$\mathrm{tmf}$$ by $$\nu$$
by relating it to the moduli stack of elliptic curves with a chosen splitting of
the Hodge filtration; this results in a calculation of the resulting
descent/Adams-Novikov spectral sequence. This $$\mathbf{E}_1$$-quotient is a
homotopical lift of *quasimodular forms*; the article contains a calculation of
the *integral* ring of quasimodular forms. Latest version fixes a small
calculational error (results remain unchanged).

* <a href="/files/diffcoh-loop-group.pdf">Loop groups and intertwining of
  positive-energy representations (2021)</a>. Last update: September 2021.
Chapter 22 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12250">this book</a>.<br>
A brief introduction to representations of loop groups; in particular, focusing
on a theorem of Pressley-Segal stating that any positive-energy representation
of $$LG$$ extends to a projective intertwining action of
$$\mathrm{Diff}^+(S^1)$$. Edited by the indicated authors of the book on arXiv.

* <a href="/files/ehp.pdf">On the James and Hilton-Milnor Splittings, and the
  metastable EHP sequence (2019)</a>, joint with <a
href="http://math.mit.edu/~phaine/">Peter Haine</a>. Last update: November 2020.
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04130">arXiv</a>. Published in <i><a
href="https://www.elibm.org/article/10012158">Doc. Math.</a></i><br>
Studies the James and Hilton-Milnor splittings and the metastable EHP sequences
in higher category theory; this allows a generalization of the James and
Hilton-Milnor splittings to motivic spaces over any base scheme.  Two proofs of
the metastable EHP sequence are provided; one is new and non-calculational, and
(essentially) only utilizes the Blakers-Massey theorem.

* <a href="/files/witten.pdf">The Ando-Hopkins-Rezk orientation is surjective
  (2019).</a> Last update: January 2020. <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10534">arXiv</a>.<br>
Shows that the Ando-Hopkins-Rezk orientation $$\mathrm{MString} \to
\mathrm{tmf}$$ is surjective on homotopy. This is done by constructing an
$$\mathbf{E}_1$$-ring $$B$$ with an $$\mathbf{E}_1$$-map $$B\to
\mathrm{MString}$$, and showing that the composite $$B \to \mathrm{MString} \to
\mathrm{tmf}$$ is surjective on homotopy. <a
href="/files/input-B-leq-24-prime-2.md">File for generating the Adams chart</a>
via Hood Chatham's <a
href="https://spectralsequences.github.io/rust_webserver/">Ext calculator</a>.

* <a href="/files/roots-of-unity.pdf">Roots of unity in $$K(n)$$-local rings
  (2017).</a> Published in <i><a href="https://doi.org/10.1090/proc/14960">Proc.
Amer. Math.  Soc</a></i>.  Last update: November 2019. <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09957">arXiv</a>.<br>
Shows that for $$n>0$$, any $$K(n)$$-local $$H_\infty$$-ring $$R$$ with a
primitive $$p^k$$-th root of unity in $$\pi_0 R$$ is trivial. This implies that
the Lubin-Tate tower does not lift to a tower of derived stacks over Morava
E-theory.

* Two books on algebraic topology, notes from course taught by Haynes Miller.
  Last update: April 2018.<br>
These notes (especially the stuff from 18.906) have been heavily modified by
Haynes, and published as a book; see <a href =
"https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/12132#t=aboutBook">here</a>.<br>
	* <a href="/files/main1.pdf">Algebraic Topology I (2018)</a>. Published

Topology II (2018)</a>. Those notes are a cleaned up version of the
somewhat-cleaned-up version of <a href="/files/main2.pdf">my edited notes</a>.

* <a href="/files/frobenius-de-rham.pdf">The Dieudonn'e modules and Ekedahl-Oort
  types of Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves in odd characteristic (2017)</a>,
with John Halliday. Last update: December 2017. <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04921">arXiv</a>.
Provides explicit formulae for the Frobenius and Verschiebung acting on the mod
p Dieudonn'e module of the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve, when p is an odd
prime. These formulae are used to settle some questions posed by Glass and Pries
from 2004. The code used is available at <a
href="https://github.com/sanathdevalapurkar/dieudonne-modules">this github
repository</a>.

* <a href="/files/gh.pdf">The Lubin-Tate stack and Gross-Hopkins duality
  (2017).</a> Last update: July 2018. <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04806">arXiv</a>.<br>
Uses derived algebraic geometry to provide proofs and generalizations of some
duality phenomena in K(n)-local stable homotopy theory. (Fixed some typos and
technical errors, and some results on K(n)-local Spanier-Whitehead self-duality
of higher real K-theories.)

* <a href="/files/talbot-notes.pdf">Talbot proceedings: Obstruction theory for
  structured ring spectra (2017)</a>, joint with Eva Belmont et. al. Last
