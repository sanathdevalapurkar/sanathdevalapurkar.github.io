### Part iv: applications

Our goal in this post is to understand deformation quantization in
characteristic $$p$$ following
[Bezrukavnikov-Kaledin](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0501247) through the
perspective that deformation quantizations in characteristic $$p$$ are refined
by $$S^1$$-actions (and they are "the same" in characteristic zero, as expressed
by the equation $$\hbar = u$$). I'm not going to try to prove their main results
from a homotopical perspective in this post, but I'll try to explain how the
structures they're interested in naturally fall out of homotopy theory. Also, in
previous posts, I was using cohomological grading (which I'm very uncomfortable
with), so we will switch to homological grading in this post. We will also only
work with *odd* primes (but this is mostly cosmetic).

Let us begin by recalling some definitions from their paper. Fix a field $$k$$
of characteristic $$p$$, and let $$A$$ be a commutative $$k$$-algebra. A
Frobenius-constant quantization of $$A$$ is a flat associative
$$k[\![\hbar]\!]$$-algebra $$A_\hbar$$ such that $$A_\hbar/\hbar = A$$ (this is
just a quantization) along with a multiplicative central
$$k[\![\hbar]\!]$$-linear splitting map $$s:A_\hbar^{(p)} \to A_\hbar$$ which
kills $$\hbar$$, and $$s(a) \equiv a^p \pmod{\hbar^{p-1}}$$. This gives a
Frobenius-linear operation $$A \to A$$ sending

$$a\mapsto a^{[p]} = \frac{a^p - s(a)}{\hbar^{p-1}}.$$

A quantized algebra along with the datum of a Frobenius-linear operation that
satisfies some axiomatic properties that $$a\mapsto a^{[p]}$$ satisfies is said
to be a restricted quantized algebra. Using the above formula to define $$s$$
given $$a\mapsto a^{[p]}$$, we see that restricted quantized algebras are the
same thing as a Frobenius-constant quantization.

I would like to explain a homotopical interpretation of Frobenius-constant
quantizations, from our point of view that $$\hbar = u$$: we will see that
Frobenius-constant quantizations have a natural homotopical analogue, given by
cyclotomic spectra. The above expression for $$a^{[p]}$$ tells us that 

$$s(a) = a^p - \hbar^{p-1} a^{[p]}.$$

According to our equation $$\hbar = u$$, we should think of $$s$$ as sending
$$a$$ to $$a^p - u^{p-1} a^{[p]}$$ --- but the only way this can be a
homogeneous expression is if $$a$$ lives in degree $$|u| = -2$$. However, the
map $$s$$ would then not be homogeneous. No worries; we can just scale by
$$u^{1-p}$$ instead, giving a map $$s'$$ by

$$s'(a) = a^p u^{1-p} - a^{[p]}.$$

Now, suppose $$A$$ is a coconnective $$\Eoo$$-$$\FF_p$$-algebra which only has
homotopy in even degrees. Then, the Tate-valued Frobenius $$\varphi: A\to
A^{tC_p}$$ is given on homotopy by sending $$x\in \pi_{-2n}(A)$$ to

$$\varphi(x) = \sum_{i\geq 0} Q_i(x) u^{(n-i)(1-p)},$$

but there are signs in front of the terms. Here, $$Q_i: \pi_n A\to
\pi_{np+2i(p-1)} A$$ is the $$i$$th lower-indexed Dyer-Lashof operation. Observe
that because $$A$$ increases the degree, and $$A$$ is coconnective, we have that
$$Q_i(x) = 0$$ for $$x\in \pi_{-n}(A)$$ once

$$i(p-1)>\frac{np}{2(p-1)};$$

in particular, this sum is finite, and when $$x\in \pi_{-2} A$$, we have

$$\varphi(x) = Q_0(x) u^{1-p} - Q_1(x) = x^p u^{1-p} - Q_1(x),$$

where I believe I've got the signs right in this equation.

Suppose instead that $$A$$ is not $$\Eoo$$, but only $$\E_2$$. What is the
appropriate fix then? In that case, the expression still holds --- but the map
$$Q_1$$ is not additive. Rather, we have

$$Q_1(x+y) = Q_1(x) + Q_1(y) + \sum_{i=1}^{p-1} s_i(x,y),$$

where $$s_i(x,y)$$ is the Lie polynomial specified by the generating function

$$(\mathrm{ad}(tx+y))^{p-1}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{p-1} is_i(x,y) t^{i-1}.$$

Here, the adjoint action $$\mathrm{ad}$$ is given by the Browder bracket (which
shifts degrees by $$n$$). It's tricky to find a reference for this statement, so
let me point out that it's Theorem III.1.3(5) in
[Cohen-Lada-May](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/BOOKS/homo_iter.pdf).

More generally, we now see that the restricted structure $$a\mapsto a^{[p]}$$ on
a quantized algebra is exactly analogous to the Dyer-Lashof operation $$Q_1$$ on
$$\pi_{-2}$$ of a coconnective even-concentrated $$\E_2$$-$$\FF_p$$-algebra.
Let's now try to make this precise in the case of Hochschild cohomology. Recall
that if $$R$$ is a smooth $$\FF_p$$-algebra, then the Hochschild cohomology
$$\fr{Z}(R/\FF_p)$$ (I would use different notation, but $$\HC$$ also has a
meaning in this world, and Hochschild cohomology *is* the center) is
coconnective, and has $$\pi_{-n} \fr{Z}(R/\FF_p) = \bigwedge^n_R T_R$$ (where
$$T_R = (\Omega^1_{R/k})^\vee$$). In particular, $$\pi_{-1} \fr{Z}(R/\FF_p) =
T_R$$ is the $$\FF_p$$-vector space of derivations $$\D:R\to \FF_p$$.

Given such a derivation $$\D$$, the Leibniz rule implies that $$\D^p$$ is a
derivation, and this is the derivation denoted $$\D^{[p]}$$. There is an
equation

$$(\D+\D')^{[p]} = \D^{[p]} + (\D')^{[p]} + \sum_{i=1}^{p-1} s_i(\D,\D')$$

for the $$p$$th power of the sum of two derivations $$\D$$ and $$\D'$$, which
looks exactly like the equation for $$Q_1$$ of a sum. (Both are grouped under
the name "Jacobson formula".) We would therefore like the assignment $$\D
\mapsto \D^{[p]}$$ to be observed by $$Q_1$$ in Hochschild cohomology, but this
doesn't quite work: $$\D\in \pi_{-1} \fr{Z}(R/\FF_p)$$, and $$Q_1$$ sends
$$\pi_{-1}$$ to $$\pi_{-p+2(p-1)} = \pi_{p-2}$$. However, if we could look at a
"sheared" version $$\fr{Z}_u(R/\FF_p)$$ of $$\fr{Z}(R/\FF_p)$$, such that
$$\fr{Z}_u(R/\FF_p)$$ is also an $$\E_2$$-$$\FF_p$$-algebra, and such that
$$\pi_{2n} \fr{Z}_u(R/\FF_p) \cong \pi_n \fr{Z}(R/\FF_p)$$, then the Dyer-Lashof
operation $$Q_1$$ would operate on $$\pi_{-2} \fr{Z}_u(R/\FF_p)$$ by $$\D\mapsto
\D^{[p]}$$.

---

This gives us some good impetus to talk about "shearing", which we also briefly
mentioned [last time](/blog/algebraic-geometry/2020/08/04/hbar-iii.html). In
characteristic zero, the shearing of a filtered $$k$$-module $$\F^\star M$$ is
the sheared Rees construction $$\bigoplus_{i\geq 0} (\F^i M) u^i$$, where $$\F^i
M$$ is placed in degree $$-2i$$ by $$u$$. You can't write out such an expression
in this way for a filtered module $$\F^\star M$$ over a general $$\Eoo$$-ring,
but we can still extract a procedure for doing the analogous construction. Let
us focus only on the case of the Whitehead filtration $$\tau_{\geq \star} M$$,
where we also assume that $$M$$ has an $$S^1$$-action.

We shall construct a $$k^{hS^1}$$-module $$M_u$$ such that $$M_u$$ is
concentrated in even degrees, $$\pi_{2n} M_u = \pi_n M$$, and the action of
$$\gr(\tau_{\geq 2\star} k^{hS^1}) = k[\![u]\!]$$ on $$\gr(\tau_{\geq 2\star}
M_u)$$ is given by

$$\gr^n(\tau_{\geq 2\star} M_u) = \Sigma^{-2n} \pi_n M \xrightarrow{d}
\Sigma^{-2n} \pi_{n+1} M = \Sigma^2 \gr^{n+1}(\tau_{\geq 2\star} M_u),$$

where the differential comes from the action of $$S^1$$. Moreover, the
assignment $$M\mapsto M_u$$ will be lax symmetric monoidal, so when we plug in
$$M = \fr{Z}(R/\FF_p)$$, we will get our desired $$\E_2$$-$$\FF_p$$-algebra
$$\fr{Z}_u(R/\FF_p)$$.

The construction we're about to describe can be found in [this
paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05246.pdf), but it's not phrased in this way
there. This "doubling" procedure is a decalage given by the underlying
$$k^{hS^1}$$-module of the connective cover $$\tau_{\geq 0}^\B (M \otimes_k
\F^\star k^{hS^1})$$. The differentials in the homotopy fixed point spectral
sequence for the $$S^1$$-action on $$M$$ then describe the action of $$u$$ on
the associated graded (of the filtration via the Beilinson connective cover),
which gives the claim of the previous paragraph.  Importantly, this construction
is lax symmetric monoidal; therefore, because $$\F^\star k^{hS^1}$$ is a
filtered $$\E_2$$-ring, we see that if $$M$$ was an $$\Eoo$$-$$k$$-algebra, then
$$M_u$$ is an $$\E_2$$-$$k$$-algebra.

---

So far, we have just seen that the assignment of the $$p$$th power of a
derivation to a derivation is a special case of the Dyer-Lashof operation
$$Q_1$$. We still haven't addressed what a Frobenius-constant structure on a
quantized algebra is supposed to be homotopified by under the equation $$\hbar =
u$$. By the discussion in the previous posts, the homotopical analogue of a
quantization $$A_\hbar$$ of a $$k$$-algebra $$A$$ is the datum of an
$$S^1$$-action on $$A$$. The splitting $$s:A^{(p)} \to A_\hbar$$ is then
homotopified by the datum of a Frobenius-linear map $$A^{(p)} \to A^{hS^1}$$ ---
but not just any map, because, as we saw, this should have something to do with
power operations. We can bake this right into the $$S^1$$-action: if we ask that
the $$S^1$$-action on $$A$$ make it into a *cyclotomic spectrum* (see
[Nikolaus-Scholze](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01799.pdf)), then we have an
$$S^1$$-equivariant "Frobenius" map $$\varphi: A^{(p)} \to A^{tC_p}$$. This map
encodes the datum of the "total power operation" on $$A$$; see, for instance,
Proposition IV.1.16 in Nikolaus-Scholze. We might therefore expect that, in
"characteristic $$p$$", the data of $$S^1$$-actions homotopify deformation
quantization, and the data of cyclotomic spectra homotopify Frobenius-constant
quantizations. It's a little difficult to make this precise (and I still haven't
been able to do so), because we have to grapple with the (related) issues of
working with $$\E_2$$-rings, and this "shearing" procedure, to really see the
power operation and its interaction with the restricted structure/splitting. I'm
trying to think about how this cyclotomic spectra perspective on
Frobenius-constant quantizations can be used to reprove (or at least,
homotopify) some of Bezrukavnikov-Kaledin's results (like the Azumaya property
of $$\hbar$$-inverted quantizations, for instance).

Obviously, I've not given any precise statement in any of the previous posts,
but being precise wasn't the intent of these posts. I just wanted to describe
the dictionary between deformation quantization, filtrations, and
$$S^1$$-actions in characteristic zero, and how utilizing $$S^1$$-actions in the
world of spectra provides a "derived algebraic geometry"/sphere spectrum lift of
deformation quantization. In a certain sense, this derived lift of deformation
quantization is more rigid, but I'd argue this is "better" because it takes into
account the additional structure present in spectra (like the widespread failure
of formality away from characteristic zero). I think it would be very
interesting to explore deformation quantization over the sphere spectrum from
this perspective.
